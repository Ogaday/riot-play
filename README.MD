Riot Play
=========

My repo for playing with the [Riot API](https://developer.riotgames) via the [Cassiopeia](https://github.com/robrua/cassiopeia) library for Python.

To get around the problem of making my key public, I store the API key string in a python file called api_key.py in a variable called key. Then at the top of my program I can import the value, but others can easily adapt the code for their own use.
